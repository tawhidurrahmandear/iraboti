Choose winners with confidence using this open-source, tamper-proof lottery software

<br><br>

## Introduction
In our lives, lotteries are often required for government or social work. Here are some examples:

1. A child is about to be admitted to a school, but there are more applicants than the available seats.
2. After 200 people attended interviews, 30 were considered qualified, each possessing the same level of qualification. However, according to the job posting, only 10 candidates will be hired.
3. A special benefit or offer is being provided, but out of numerous applicants, only a few will be chosen as winners.
4. Through a tender process, one contractor will be selected from several equally qualified candidates.

It is precisely at these moments that the lottery is needed in public. We often doubt the authenticity of these computerized lotteries. Perhaps certain numbers have been pre-set within the code to ensure specific people win. What is the solution to this problem?

To ensure the credibility of the lottery, an open-source automated lottery software is required, so that anyone can view the Source Code and verify that no manipulation has taken place. This entire software is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is made available on GitHub, allowing anyone to download it from the internet and read its code on any regular computer. Enough comments have been written in the JavaScript section for better understanding.
